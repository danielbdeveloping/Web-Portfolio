        <h2>About Daniel</h2>
        <p>
          I am new to web development and coding in general, but this has been an exciting journey thus far. I am eager to keep on learning and improving myself, both as a person and an aspiring software engineer. While I am a bit of an introvert, I am willing and happy to work with others. Different perspectives and ideas are always important, especially if I wish to continue to learn all that I can.
        </p> 
        <p class="align-center">Outside of web development, I enjoy:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Playing video games</li>
          <li>Reading novels of any genre</li>
          <li>Traveling</li>
        </ul>
        <!--I know this wasn't really a couple of sentences about me, but I believe this unordered list works a little better.-->
